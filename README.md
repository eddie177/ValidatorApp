# CV Parser and Form Validator – C# Windows Forms Application

## 📄 Project Description

This is a C# Windows Forms application developed to streamline user data validation and automate CV content extraction using **Regular Expressions (Regex)**. The application provides a user-friendly interface for both manual data entry and CV parsing, ensuring efficient and accurate data handling.

## ✨ Features

- **Manual Form Entry**  
  Allows users to input personal and professional details through a structured form.

- **CV Text Parsing**  
  Automatically extracts key information (e.g., Name, Email, Phone, Skills, Experience) from raw CV text using Regex.

- **Data Validation**  
  Validates form input fields such as email, phone number, and name format. Highlights invalid fields in **red** for better user guidance.

- **Save to File**  
  Enables saving extracted or manually entered data to a `.txt` file for future reference.
